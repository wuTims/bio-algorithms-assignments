Problem set 1:
  Generated reverse palindromic recognition sites for 6-mers, but can be extended to all k-mers
  Counted the number of times each possible 6-mer recognition site occurs in the genome sequence for a human chromosome
  Plotted a histogram for the different fragment lengths generated from a complete digestion by a restriction enzyme
  Attempted double digestion problem. Generated all possible combination of paths but was unable to form graph to find a solution path.
Problem set 2:
  Normalized a gene by slightly changing the code for Global Alignment
  Devised a method for finding the longest conserved substring shared by four gene sequences
  Generated a table showing evolutionary distances between two sequences using Global Alignment
Problem set 3:
  Code for implementing Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays was given in class
  Built suffix trees for the substrings of a human chromosome and recorded time taken to build
  Built suffix arrays for the substrings of a human chromosome and recorded time taken to build
  Extracted a suffix array from the suffix tree. Timed the extraction process and compared with time taken to construct suffix tree
